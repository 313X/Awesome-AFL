A curated list of all AFL customized versions &amp; sister projects with detailed equivalent academic papers

- [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) by [Michal Zalewski](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/)
  + Original & first versions of AFL fuzzer, american fuzzy lop is a free security-oriented fuzzer that employs genetic algorithms in order to efficiently increase code coverage of the test cases. So far it helped in detection of significant software bugs in dozens of major free software projects, including X.Org Server, PHP, OpenSSL, pngcrush, bash, Firefox, BIND, Qt, and SQLite. 

- [AFL++](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/AFLplusplus) by [van Hauser](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc) 
  + afl++ is afl 2.56b with community patches, AFLfast power schedules, qemu 3.1 upgrade + laf-intel support, MOpt mutators, InsTrim instrumentation, unicorn_mode and a lot more!
  
- [WinAFL](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl) by [Ivan Fratric](https://github.com/ifratric)
  + A fork of AFL for fuzzing Windows binaries
  
- [TriforceAFL](https://github.com/nccgroup/TriforceAFL) by [Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham of nccgroup](https://github.com/nccgroup)
  + This is a patched version of AFL that supports full-system fuzzing using QEMU. The included QEMU has been updated to allow tracing of branches when running a system emulator for x86_64. Extra instructions have been added to start AFL's forkserver, make fuzz settings, and mark the start and stop of test cases.

- [WineAFLplusplusDEMO](https://github.com/andreafioraldi/WineAFLplusplusDEMO) by [Andrea Fioraldi](https://github.com/andreafioraldi)
  + A set of helpers and examples to fuzz Win32 binaries with AFL++ QEMU
